This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function.  `IsEmpty` returns `True` for both empty strings and zero-length arrays, which can lead to difficult-to-debug issues if not handled properly. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version using more precise checks. This is a common pitfall for VBScript developers, especially when migrating or maintaining older code.
